### View the live project [here.](https://reidycolm.github.io/MS1-Project/index.html)

This is my first project as a Code Institute student. I decided to create a website for a fictitous business that specialised in boat tours along the Wild Atlantic Way. Becuase a service of this kind would attract customers of all ages and backgrounds, I thought it was very important to create a page that was easy to navigate and minimilist in its design.
 
## UX
 
#### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to know immediately what the website is about when I load the page.
* As I may be a tourist, it's very important that I can easily see pictures of where the tours operate so I know if I would like to vist them or not.
* I want to easily be able to access the website on any device as more than likely I will not have my laptop when I am travelling.

#### Returner Visitor Goals

* It's very important that I'm able to get in touch with the tour company as I may need to contact them with questions about the tours I'm booked onto.
* I want to be able to follow Blue Dolphin on social media so I can see recent updates and check out reviews from other tourists.
* As I may be returning to the site beause I'm having trouble deciding what tour to choose, I want to be able to easily compare what exactly is involved in each.

#### Design

* Colour Scheme - The primary colours used were steelblue and white. I chose these as I left artistically they worked quite well and steelblue was very similiar to an ocean colour which I felt was sutible.

* Typography - The font style used on this projecy was Lora which I sourced from Google Fonts.

* Images - I picked three clear, large images to use in the carousel slider. I wanted the person visiting the site to immediately be drawn to them and become aware that they were the locations that the tours were based on.



## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sreninc/grow-yourself)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://sreninc.github.io/grow-yourself/) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sreninc/grow-yourself)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sreninc/grow-yourself)
2. Under the repository name, click the "Code" button and a dropdown menu will appear.
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```
