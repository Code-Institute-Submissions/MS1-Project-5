### View the live project [here.](https://reidycolm.github.io/MS1-Project/index.html)

This is my first project as a Code Institute student. I decided to create a website for a fictitous business that specialised in boat tours along the Wild Atlantic Way. Becuase a service of this kind would attract customers of all ages and backgrounds, I thought it was very important to create a page that was easy to navigate and minimilist in its design.
 
## UX
 
#### First Time Visitor Goals
    1) I want to know immediately what the website is about when I load the page.
    2) As I may be a tourist, it's very important that I can easily see pictures of where the tours operate so I know if I would like to vist them or not.
    3) I want to easily be able to access the website on any device as more than likely I will not have my laptop when I am travelling.

#### Returner Visitor Goals
    1) It's very important that I'm able to get in touch with the tour company as I may need to contact them with questions about the tours I'm booked onto.
    2) I want to be able to follow Blue Dolphin on social media so I can see recent updates and check out reviews from other tourists.
    3) As I may be returning to the site beause I'm having trouble deciding what tour to choose, I want to be able to easily compare what exactly is involved in each.

#### Design

* **Colour Scheme** - The primary colours used were steelblue and white. I chose these as I left artistically they worked quite well and steelblue was very similiar to an ocean colour which I felt was sutible.

* **Typography** - The font style used on this projecy was Lora which I sourced from Google Fonts.

* **Images** - I picked three clear, large images to use in the carousel slider. I wanted the person visiting the site to immediately be drawn to them and become aware that they were the locations that the tours were based on.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sreninc/grow-yourself)
2. Under the repository name, click the "Code" button and a dropdown menu will appear.
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```
